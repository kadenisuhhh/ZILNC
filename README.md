# ZILNC
## ZFM's In-house Lyric Notation Converter
This program was made to convert Genius lyric notation to Musixmatch lyric notation and vice versa because I was fucking over manually doing it lol.

## Instructions:
ZILNC works both with and without command line arguments.

### With command line arguments:
1. (Optional but reccommended )Place ZILC.py wherever the text file you want to convert is.
2. Run ZILNC in the terminal with the following info as command line arguments in this order:
    - The name of the file you want to convert
    - The notation you want to convert to ('gen' for Genius and 'mus' for Musixmatch)
    - (optional) the output file name
3. Let ZILNC work its magic!

### No command line arguments:
1. (Optional but reccommended) Place ZILC.py wherever the text file you want to convert is.
2. Run ZILNC with the terminal orwhatever IDE you want.
3. ZILNC will ask you for the name of the file you want to convert, which notation you want to convert to and (optionally) your output file name.
4. After you enter this info, let ZILNC work its magic!

Just as an fyi, I don't know how to code :smiling_face_with_tear:
